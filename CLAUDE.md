# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Hoyo Buddy** - a static multi-language website for a Discord bot serving Hoyoverse gamers. The site is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Tailwind CSS, supporting English, Vietnamese, and Traditional Chinese.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build and watch Tailwind CSS (primary development command)
npm run build-css

# Format code with Prettier
npx prettier --write .

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Multi-language Implementation
- **English**: `index.html` (main/default)
- **Vietnamese**: `index-vi-vn.html`
- **Traditional Chinese**: `index-zh-tw.html`

Each language version is a complete HTML file with localized content. The language selector (`assets/js/language-selector.js`) handles switching between versions.

### CSS Architecture
- **Source**: `src/tailwind.css` - Tailwind directives and custom CSS
- **Compiled**: `assets/css/tailwind.css` - Generated by Tailwind CLI
- **External**: `assets/css/animate.css`, `assets/css/swiper-bundle.min.css`

### JavaScript Components
- `assets/js/main.js` - Core functionality, dark mode, animations
- `assets/js/language-selector.js` - Multi-language switching logic
- `assets/js/swiper-bundle.min.js` - Carousel functionality
- `assets/js/wow.min.js` - Scroll animations

### Styling System
Tailwind CSS with extensive customization in `tailwind.config.js`:
- Custom color palette with dark mode variants
- Extended spacing, fonts, and animation utilities
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design

### Dark Mode Implementation
Uses Tailwind's class-based dark mode (`class` strategy). Toggle managed in `main.js` with localStorage persistence.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Languages
1. Create new HTML file: `index-[lang-code].html`
2. Translate all content including meta tags
3. Update language selector options in `language-selector.js`
4. Maintain consistent structure across all language versions

### Styling Changes
- Modify `src/tailwind.css` for custom CSS
- Run `npm run build-css` to compile changes
- Use Tailwind classes for consistency
- Test dark mode variants with `dark:` prefixes

### Image Management
Images in `assets/images/` organized by sections:
- `features/` - Bot feature screenshots
- `team/` - Team member photos
- Root level - General assets (logo, hero images)

### Component Modifications
When editing JavaScript components, ensure:
- Multi-language compatibility maintained
- Dark mode functionality preserved
- Mobile responsiveness intact
- Animation timing remains smooth
